<h1>&#9728; Summer Chores &#9728;</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Bob has a list of summer chores to do every Saturday. There are a lot of chores for him to do, and naturally, he gets more tired while completing his tasks. If he gets too tired, he might fall asleep before completing all the chores.</p>
<p>He has a strict routine, which follows in order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Mowing the yard</li>
  <li>Weedeating the edges of the house and fence line</li>
  <li>Trimming the hedges</li>
  <li>Collect fallen wood for summer night fires</li>
  <li>Water the garden</li>
</ol>
<p>If he manages not to get tired and fall asleep while doing his chores, he will have successfully completed his chores. Also, there's never a chance of him falling asleep before mowing the yard.</p>
